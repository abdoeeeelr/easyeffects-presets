### My presets collection for [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) on Linux🎧🔈🐧

| Preset name | Description |
| - | - |
| `Inspiron 3576`, `insp3576_*` | A preset to decrappify built-in speaker for any Dell laptop with 1K1WD speaker part (i.e. Inspiron 3576). It's tuned by ear so don't expect any accuracy. But IMO it's better than what you have on its Windows driver.<br><br>There's three version: `insp3576_bass` has louder bass at the expense of lower volume for the rest of frequency, vanilla is a balance between bass response and the rest, while `_louder` reduces the bass even more (but still better than none, I hope...). |
| `Crystalized Crap` | Supposed to be used with crappy earphone. Crystalizer is the heart of this preset. Multiband compressor reduces harsh high caused by Crystalizer and adjusted to my liking. (still need to tweak it tbh, Crystalizer is weird) |
| `Radioification` | A preset that kinda resembles average radio station audio processor. It has Autogain for stable volume and Bass Enhancer to thicken and warm the bass. Also, I use Classic mode on MB compressor to give "boomy" non-phase linear bass. You might find it fatiguing to listen for long time as the compressor is pretty aggressive. |

Feel free to do whatever with my presets, as it's still kinda sucks imo
