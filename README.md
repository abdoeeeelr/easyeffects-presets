### My presets collection for [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) on Linux🎧🔈🐧

| Preset name | Description |
| - | - |
| `Inspiron 3576` and `Inspiron 3576 - Lite` | A preset to decrappify built-in speaker for Dell Inspiron 15 3576 (or any Dell laptop with 1K1WD speaker part tbh). It's tuned by ear so don't expect any accuracy. But IMO it's better than what you have on its Windows driver. (I guess Dell back in 2017 didn't fully dive into DSP game until Apple and their MacBooks?)<br><br>There's two version, the lite version is bit easier on CPU since there's no multiband compressor, while the vanilla one uses multiband compressor to stabilize volume between content. |
| `Crystalized Crap` | Supposed to be used with crappy earphone. Crystalizer is the heart of this preset. Multiband compressor reduces harsh high caused by Crystalizer and adjusted to my liking. (still need to tweak it tbh, Crystalizer is weird) |
| `Radioification` | A preset that kinda resembles average radio station audio processor. It has Autogain for stable volume and Bass Enhancer to thicken and warm the bass. Also, I use Classic mode on MB compressor to give "boomy" non-phase linear bass. You might find it fatiguing to listen for long time as the compressor is pretty aggressive. |

Feel free to do whatever with my presets, idc
