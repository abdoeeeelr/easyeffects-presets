### My presets collection for [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) on Linux🎧🔈🐧

| Preset name | Description |
| - | - |
| `Inspiron 3576` and `Inspiron 3576 - Less Bass` | A preset to decrappify built-in speaker for Dell Inspiron 15 3576 series. It's tuned by ear so don't expect any accuracy. But IMO it's better than what you have on its Windows driver. (I guess Dell back in 2017 didn't fully dive into DSP game until Apple and their MacBooks?)<br><br>The only drawback is volume loss and slight occasional distortion as I push the bass to be louder than the rest. Less bass variant is for those who prefer louder but brighter sound. |
| `Crystalized Crap` | Supposed to be used with crappy earphone. Crystalizer is the heart of this preset. Multiband compressor reduces harsh high caused by Crystalizer and adjusted to my liking. (still need to tweak it tbh, Crystalizer is weird) |
| `Radioification` | A preset that kinda resembles average radio station audio processor. It has Autogain for stable volume and Bass Enhancer to thicken and warm the bass. Also, I use Classic mode on MB Compressor to give "boomy" non-phase linear bass. This is my favourite, but you might found it fatiguing to listen for long time as the compressor is pretty aggressive. |

Feel free to do whatever with my presets, idc
